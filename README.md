# Dotfiles
I like the warm colors of the [Gruvbox](!https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme


Wallpapers from [Wallpapers Cave](!https://wallpapercave.com/gruvbox-wallpapers)


Remember to:
- copy the sddm config files to /etc/sddm.conf.d/ and place the wallpaper in /usr/share/sddm/themes/maldives, naming it background.jpg
- install rofi themes from [github](!https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) and then copy my modified dotfiles there in $HOME/.config/rofi
- Change colors and styles to rofi themes:



This theme should also be compatible with my Thinkpad Yoga 370, some polybar modules are there to be used while in touchscreen mode, but they also have a keyboard shortcut define in i3 config. For polybar, remember to install [fontawesome](!https://fontawesome.com) (`ttf-font-awesome` package if on ArchLinux)
